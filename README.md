# Classification-Metrics
This repository discusses and implements most commonly used classification metrics.

In this repo, we discuss and implement the following classification metrics, which are widely used to evaluate the performance of a ML model for a classification tasks, some of these might be totally new to you and some of which are quite common.

* Accuracy
* Precision
* Recall
* F1-Score
* AUC-ROC
* Log-Loss
* Cohen-Kappa
* Matthew's Correlation Coefficient

All the above metrics are implemented in the code, and you can use this as a boilerplate to understand each metric, along with an implementation for future use.
